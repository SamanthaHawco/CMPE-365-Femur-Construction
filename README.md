# CMPE-365-Femur-Construction

Computer algorithms course assignment in which I wrote a dynamic programming algorithm to compute 
a minium-area triangulatino between two contours in 3-dimentions. 

This algorithm is used to model a 3D visualization of a femur by connecting contour slices in a similar manner 
to how medical imagining is translated from machine information to practical visuals. 

The base code and project idea is accredited to James Stewart. Professor Ph.D.
